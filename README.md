# DigiGirlzCodingChallenge
##Intro
This repo was designed as a Digi Girlz coding challenge! It should take ~an hour and is useful for not super deep technical ability. It covers Python, HTML, and flask.

##For beginners:
The code in the .py file is written in Python. 
The code in the /templates folder that end in .html is written in HTML.
We are using a combination of both of these and a microframework called Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/) to build a small locally hosted website!





##SETUP:
If you're new to github check out: https://guides.github.com/
If you're new to navigating the Command Prompt check out: http://ifoundthemeaningoflife.com/learntocode/cmd101win
Open a Command Prompt/terminal and navigate to where the code files are being held or where you want them to land.

_I do recommend using virtual environments to manage the dependencies for your python projects. However, I will not be covering that in this project as it's aimed at beginners! If you want to find out more about how to use them with flask check out the documentation here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#virtual-environments_

Then run: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CRehfuss/DigiGirlzCodingChallenge.git
```

Navigate to the DigiGirlzCodingChallenge folder.
```sh
cd DigiGirlzCodingChallenge
```

Download flask via the command prompt
```sh
pip install Flask
```
or 
```sh
python -m pip install Flask
```

_Hopefully_ that ran without any issues!!

Open the files in VS Code or any ide that supports python!
